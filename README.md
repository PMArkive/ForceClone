# IMPORTANT
As of 26/07/2022 VRChat released an update which includes a kernel anti-cheat known as Easy Anti-Cheat, this makes the usage of mods impossible. While this may stop mods that can be used maliciously such as force clone, it also stops users from using mods that are actually necessary to improve the game's qol.
